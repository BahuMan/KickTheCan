# KickTheCan
Online Multiplayer Variant of the well-known children's game

# done:
- local multiplayer host
- clients can join
- moving is possibly & synchronized
- 1 player is designated "it"
- puff of smoke when shooting
- server assigns "it", other players are hiding

# todo:
- holding pen for tagged players
- bug: when all players tagged, "it" gets status "hiding" but nobody gets status "it" ?
- bug, not glitch: in the 5 seconds "unlocked", players can put themselves on the wrong side of the fence (inside when they're not tagged, outside although they've been tagged (again, in the 5 seconds) ==> can we settle collisions with tags instead?
- cross hair
- HUD
